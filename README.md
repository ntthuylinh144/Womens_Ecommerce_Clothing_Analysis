-----


**📌 Project Overview**
Duration: Apr 2025 – Present

Role: Individual Project

Tools: Python, Pandas, NLTK, Seaborn, Matplotlib


**🎯 Objectives**
Perform in-depth analysis of customer reviews on women’s clothing products.

Clean and preprocess raw text data to prepare for sentiment and keyword analysis.

Visualize statistical relationships and key patterns in customer opinions.



**🔍 Key Features**
**✅ Data Preprocessing**
Cleaned textual data (e.g., spelling correction, removing stopwords).

Applied stemming and lemmatization using nltk and spaCy.

**✅ Statistical Analysis**
Conducted:

Univariate analysis (e.g., rating distribution)

Bivariate analysis (e.g., rating vs. sentiment)

Multivariate analysis (e.g., age group, rating, and review length)

**✅ Text Analysis**
Performed Sentiment Analysis to classify review polarity.

Applied N-gram modeling to find common word patterns.

Created Word Clouds to visualize top keywords.



**📈 Visualization Examples**
Distribution of ratings and sentiment classes.

Word clouds of positive vs. negative reviews.

Bar plots showing average ratings per clothing category.

Age group vs. review sentiment correlation.



**🧰 Tech Stack**
Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud, spaCy
